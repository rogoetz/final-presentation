	<aside class='notes'> 
				 <p>
					XKCD is a webcomic created by artist Randall Munroe. He started it in 2005, as a place where he could put up old doodles he had scanned, but has since become something else, with original content being posted three times a week.

<h1>How does a webcomic relate to this class?</h1>
<p>&quot;in many ways, this entire class is designed to help you understand the jokes in XKCD&quot; --John D. Martin III</p>
<p><a href="http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Explain XKCD</a></p>
	
	<aside class='notes'>
	<p>
		XKCD is a webcomic that, according to the author, is about 'romance, sarcasm, math, and language'. The author is a computer science geek who worked at NASA prior to starting XKCD, so many of his jokes related to computer concepts, some of which we've learned in class.

<h1>Learning about Linux</h1>
	
	<img src="images/xkcdcautionary.png" alt="XKCD Cautionary" title="Cautionary"/>
	
	<aside class='notes'>
	<p>
		When learning about things (like why Linux is both good, and highly problematic to install), I kept thinking back to comics I saw and relating them to class.

	<aside class='notes'>
	<p>
		this is another comic that I thought of after we learned how to use SQL, for obvious reasons.

<section id="what-kind-of-person-makes-this-sort-of-thing" class="slide level1" data-background="#96A8C8">
<h1>What kind of person makes this sort of thing?</h1>
<p>Randall Munroe does</p>
	<aside class='notes'>
	<p>
		As mentioned, he used to work at NASA as a roboticist prior to starting XKCD. He now works only on XKCD and some related projects. 
		</p></aside>

<section id="personal-and-oddball" class="slide level1" data-background="https://xkcd.com/456/">
<h1>Personal and Oddball</h1>
	
	<img src='images/xkcdtwoyears.png' alt='two years' title='two years'/>
	
	<aside class='notes'>
	<p>
		A lot of the comic is jokes about science and technology, or small, silly narratives about various characters, but it also gets personal sometimes. This comic is looking back at the author's wife's battle with breast cancer, something he made several comics about. 
		</p></aside>

<section id="other-projects" class="slide level1" data-background="#96A8C8" >
<h1>Other Projects</h1>
<p><a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/">What If</a></p>
	<aside class='notes'>
	<p>
		As mentioned, there are some other projects that Munroe has worked on. He had a blog and published a book based on it, answering absurd questions with hard science. Examples include 'how much power can Yoda output' and 'what would a mole of moles look like'. 
		He also published a book called 'Thing Explainer', which explains difficult concepts like space travel using only the 1,000 most common English words.

<section id="is-this-actually-a-thing" class="slide level1" data-background="#96A8C8">
<h1>Is this actually a thing?</h1>
<p>2014: Best Graphic Story <a href="http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/">Time</a></p>
	<aside class='notes'>
	<p>
		In case any of you were wondering why I was blathering on about a random webcomic, it actually is quite well-known. Munroe won a Hugo Award for one comic, and several others have been widely used and shared. He also had an Asteroid named after him by the International Astonomical Union.

<section id="how-does-this-relate-to-me-again" class="slide level1" data-background="#96A8C8">
<h1>How does this relate to me again?</h1>
	<aside class='notes'>
	<p>
		Well, it doesn't really, but I thought it would be a fun presentation. And, in case any of you think you didn't learn much, the fact that you can understand some of these jokes is proof that the class achieved its objective.
